### What I learned

In this section I learnent the usage and manipulation of svg icons

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<svg class="icon-svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path
    d="M21.5,15a3,3,0,0,0-1.9-2.78l1.87-7a1,1,0,0,0-.18-.87A1,1,0,0,0,20.5,4H6.8L6.47,2.74A1,1,0,0,0,5.5,2h-2V4H4.73l2.48,9.26a1,1,0,0,0,1,.74H18.5a1,1,0,0,1,0,2H5.5a1,1,0,0,0,0,2H6.68a3,3,0,1,0,5.64,0h2.36a3,3,0,1,0,5.82,1,2.94,2.94,0,0,0-.4-1.47A3,3,0,0,0,21.5,15Zm-3.91-3H9L7.34,6H19.2ZM9.5,20a1,1,0,1,1,1-1A1,1,0,0,1,9.5,20Zm8,0a1,1,0,1,1,1-1A1,1,0,0,1,17.5,20Z"
  />
</svg>
```

```css
.icon-svg {
  width: 1.5em;
  height: 1.5em;
  color: var(--white);
  fill: var(--white);
}
```
