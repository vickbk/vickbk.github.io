## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this section I learned to use html and css only to show and hide some specific content without using javascript with the details element only

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<details>
  <summary>The summary</summary>
  other content
</details>
```

### Continued development

In future I will try to use this element as much as possible along with other cool accessible elements.
