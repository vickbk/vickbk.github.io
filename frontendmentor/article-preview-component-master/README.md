## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (using SASS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanila JS for site interraction

### What I learned

I learnt again how to draw the arrow using the borders

```css
element::after {
  content: "";
  inline-size: 0;
  block-size: 0;
  border-inline: 1em solid transparent; /* Adjust size as needed */
  border-block-start: 1em solid c.$dark-grey-blue; /* Color of the arrow */
}
```

### Continued development

I am still struggling with SASS but I am also starting to feel comfortable now with sass and with practice it will be fine.
