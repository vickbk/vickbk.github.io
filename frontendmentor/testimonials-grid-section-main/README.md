## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS for CSS optimization

### What I learned

In this section I reviewed the CSS Grid layout design and used it to complete the challenge.

### Continued development

I am still struggling with SASS but I am also starting to feel comfortable now with it and with practice it will be fine.
