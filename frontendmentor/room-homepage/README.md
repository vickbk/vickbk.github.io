## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this section I learnt to work with css transitions though I did not manage to use them for the slide show.

### Continued development

I will keep working on CSS transitions as I need master them along with animations
