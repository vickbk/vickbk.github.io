## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Wrapping the card item in the main element with 100vh for height to better center it vertically.
Then use css grid display and place-items property to center for vertical and horizontal center alignment

below some code snippet for this

```html
<main class="holder">
  <!-- card code in here -->
</main>
```

```css
.holder {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

Following from here I want to focus on building more awesome projects with the help of frontend mentor :) and see what it gives out
