## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learnet how to use the tailwindcss library and it was pretty good ride-through.
I was pissed of with the long list of utility classes at first, then I learnt how to use them is css files directly with the @apply directive.

```html
<h1 class="my-title">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.my-title {
  @apply text-center p-4 text-xl;
}
```

### Continued development

I will try to use tailwind in later projects as to get more familiar with the library;
