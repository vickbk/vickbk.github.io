### Built with

- SCSS for more organised CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Here I mostly learnt the basic usage of SASS for a more reusable CSS.

### Continued development

For the up coming challenges I will keep practicing SASS as to get more familiar and improve my usage of it.
