## Overview

### The challenge

In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously in a different project. The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website.

  - Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
  - Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
  - A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.

#### Bonus Points

- For bonus points, you can:

  - Use Google Fonts to enhance the typography of your website.
  - Look into GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages to host your website for free.
  - Add support for dark mode using CSS variables.

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
